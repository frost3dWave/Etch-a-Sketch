# Etch-a-Sketch

## About
NOTE :- please view it on desktop, as its not responsive & was created for desktop.
A JavaScript project created as part of The Odin Project. 
the grid is dynamically created based on the size selected. 
choose the different modes to sketch over the grid while clicking with & moving mouse over the grid.
Rainbow mode randomizes the colors each time you pass over the grid. 
similarly erasure lets you erase the currently colored grids & clear resets the grid to default.

## Reflections
This project was a challenge as compared to one's I did before & I am extemely happy with how it turned out. 
This project was heavy in DOM manipulation, and as such helped me practice while reinforcing the concepts & techniques essential for it. 
I have also tried adding comments this time for explaining what does each function/piece of code does to improve readability & practice writing clean code.
